This method requires you to be on 3-4 different Middleman Discord Servers

Firstly you'll have to go to the middleman-request channel or DM someone in general who is requesting a Middleman after you have done that!

Message them on Discord and say Hello you've request a middleman? If they say "no", just delete your past messages and leave if they say "Yes", continue the conversation until they either join you or trade you their items through Roblox or in-game. 

It's recommended that you use a Discord account over 30+ days otherwise it'll be suspicious that you have a new account indicating to them that it's a scam Make sure your Roblox account is named Middleman and it is a new account so they don't trace you.
