Rbx Flip

1.) Go to rbxflip.com and find a victim you're gonna comp. (Note: make sure the person your comping made his account between november to october. 2020
Find out the date in which the account he made was created (Most alts for flip buy premium the day they make the account.)
 
2.) Once u verified that the guy bought premium on that day go to roblox.com/support and fill out a form that your account has been hacked.
Roblox should respond in a day but that should be enough time to follow through with it.
 
3.) Roblox should ask for the first reciept added on the account, Following through just inspect element the day the account was made and respond with the reciept.
Roblox will then go through the reciept and see that its the right date. and should revert the email of the account.
this is just explained better
