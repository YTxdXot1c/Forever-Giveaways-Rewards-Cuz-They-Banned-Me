- Basically you're pretending to scam your joint partner, but you're really
scamming the other person)
- Scamming Method -
[1] Find someone on Trade Hangout with an item you want (Keep in mind the
more the value of the item, the harder)
[2] Ask him, "Hey, don't you play apoc?"
[3] if they say...
"Yes" - continue with the steps below
"No" - welp, find someone else
[4] Ask them "Do you have skype? So we could play together some time"
[5] Send them a friend request on skype
[6] Once they accepted your friend request, greet them. Attract them into the
scam. ("What's your stats on Apoc?")
[7] After you have become somewhat their 'Friend', Ask them ("Could you help
me do something though?")
[8] They're gonna be like "What?"
[9] Tell them:
Could you help me scam (YOUR JOINT PARNER'S USERNAME), he is a major
scammer all over trade hangout and he scammed my friends, We could split the
profit. You could have (highest limited) and I could have (any other limited). He'll
be easy I can assure you, since he's desperate for items. I'll just guide you in
what to say, and I'll jump in when the time comes.
Alright cool, thanks for helping me. I'll invite everyone to a party ok?
[11] If he says ok, then go ahead and invite your joint partner and him to the party
[12] Your joint partner is to accept the party like 1 minute late, just so that it's not
suspecious
[13] After everyone is in the party, tell the guy you're gonna scam to put this into
the party:
(JointPartnerUsername), will you be willing to let me borrow your item for an
outfit I want to save?
[14] Joint Partner says: Why for an outfit?
[15] Now tell the guy to say this into the party: "Cause I collect outfits"
[16] Joint Partner says: How do I know you're legit
[17] Now YOU go in the party and say "He's legit, he borrowed an item from me"
[18] Joint Partner says: Hmm if (VICTIM) is legit as he says you are, then let
(YOURUSERNAME) hold your items
[19] If the victim gets all caught up with this, and doesn't want to do it. CONVINCE
HIM. TIPS BELOW
[20] Boom, once victim sends the trade to your jointpartner, your jointpartner
splits the scam with you. You both get half and half.
[21] 9+10 = 21, hehehe. Anyways, make sure you block the victim, and block him
on roblox too.
TIPS FOR CONVINCING:
- "I understand you're afraid, I am too. You don't have to trust me bro, we could
try something else" (Then make up a stupid thing with your joint partner)
- "You have to trust me bro, we're this close to scamming him. We'll be rich if you
just trust me"
- "I'll trade back your items for my half of the scam"
